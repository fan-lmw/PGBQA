# **Dataset**
The experiments use the Drone Vehicle and AVIID dataset. The **Drone Vehicle dataset** comprises RGB-Infrared images captured by drones for vehicle detection, covering various scenarios such as urban roads, residential areas, 
and parking lots, with both daytime and nighttime scenes. Each image pair, consisting of visible and infrared modalities, has a resolution of 640×512. From the original images, we selected **3721** pairs containing various components 
such as roads, vegetation, and vehicles for the training set, which cover diverse environments and object structures with clear information. The test set, consisting of **4000** pairs. All images were centrally cropped to a size of **512×512**. 
The **AVIID dataset** consists of paired aerial visible and infrared images captured by dual-camera drones. Specifically, AVIID-3 contains 1280 pairs of visible-infrared images, each with a size of 480×480, characterized by a higher density 
and diversity of vehicles, varied target scales, and multiple elements. Consequently, we selected **647** pairs for the training set and **207** pairs for the test set, with all images directly resized to **256×256** without cropping.
